If every potential user task is made accessible — so multiple modalities are supported — a user can choose what works best. For instance, if a user can't use or doesn't have access to a mouse, but can use and access a keyboard, the keyboard can call a modality independent control to activate an OnMouseOver event. Another example is a user on a mobile device that lacks keyboard who uses uses taps, wirelessly connected devices, and voice commands to simulate discrete or keyboard input.
